__Game plan (inspired by OG Pac-Man):__
* General overview
  * On entry to the game, the players will spawn on one corner of the map.
  * ***The AIM*** of the game is to keep eating the 'pellets' which will randomly spawn on the map. Eat as many pellets as you can, first player to eat all the pellets, wins
    * 1 pellet = 1 score
